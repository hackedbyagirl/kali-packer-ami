//  variables.pkr.hcl

// This is where the HCL varaibels are declared. You could put these at the top of
// your main .pkr.hcl file, but it is good practice to keep your variables files
// seperate.

// Variable declarations for input variables. Input variables serve as parameters
// for a Packer build, allowing aspects of the build to be customized without
// altering the build's own source code.
